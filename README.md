# 🧠 Student Depression Risk Analysis

This project explores and models mental health trends among students using the Student Depression Dataset. The goal is to identify key lifestyle, academic, and personal factors contributing to student depression risk, and to build an interpretable machine learning model that can predict and explain those risks.

The project is part of a personal initiative to build meaningful, end-to-end machine learning applications through 2-week sprints.

## 🚀 Key Objectives
* Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis and modeling.
* Explore correlations between student lifestyle factors and depression symptoms.
* Build a classifier to predict high-risk individuals.
* Use explainability tools (e.g., SHAP) to identify important features.
* Optionally, deploy an interactive web app to visualize predictions and insights.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn, SHAP)
* Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and modeling
